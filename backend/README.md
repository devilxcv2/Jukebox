## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

### Software
*   **Python:** Version 3.7 or higher recommended.
*   **VLC (libvlc Library):** The core VLC library needs to be installed on the system. The application uses `python-vlc`, which interfaces with this library.
    *   **Linux:** Usually installable via package manager (e.g., `sudo apt install libvlc-dev libvlccore-dev vlc` on Debian/Ubuntu, `sudo dnf install vlc-devel` on Fedora).
    *   **Windows/macOS:** Installing VLC Media Player from the official [videolan.org](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/) website should provide the necessary libraries.
*   **FFmpeg (Optional, for MP3 Download):** Only required if you want to use the MP3 download and conversion feature. It must be installed and available in the system's PATH for the script to detect it.
    *   Visit [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) for installation instructions for your platform.

### Python Libraries
You can install these using `pip`:
